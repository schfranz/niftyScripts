# niftyScripts
Contains little scripts that do useful things I will presumably need to do more than once in my life.

## What to expect in this README
Files are listed in "Files and Features" with a brief comment on what they do (because hopefully I still sort of remember that) and a list of special techniques I used in the language they are written in. This way, I have both a brief overview over what kinds of scripts exist in terms of what they can do and a resource for writing more advanced scripts without having to Google every single command.

## To Do
* Figure out how to use automated comments (one day...)

## Files and Features
* renameFiles.sh: recursively replaces non-alphanumeric symbols in file and folder names with underscores
	- recursion in folders
	- functions and function calls in BASH
	- regular expressions
